A brief introduction to Logistic Regression:

- Logistic regression is a statistical approach for producing results in **binary format** which is used to predict the outcome of a categorial dependent variable. So the outcome should be **discrete/categorical** such as:
**"0 or 1"**,
**"Yes or No"**,
**"True or False"** and
**"High or Low"**

- Logistic regression describes and estimates the relationship between one dependent binary variable and independent variables.

- The sigmoid function, also called logistic function gives an ‘S’ shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1.

# Types of Logistic Regression

- **Binary Logistic Regression**: The target variable has only two possible outcomes such as **"Spam or Not Spam"**, **"Cancer or No Cancer"**.

- **Multinomial Logistic Regression**: The target variable has three or more nominal categories such as **predicting the type of Wine**.

- **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: The target variable has three or more ordinal categories such as **restaurant or product rating from 1 to 5**.
